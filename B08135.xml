            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Ven as by the law of God &amp; man, Children are bounde to honour, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, &amp; obey their Parents, both Spirituall and Temporall: ſo in like ſort is it comprehended in the ſame, that Parents are no leſſe obliged to haue a due care to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and correct, to comfort alſo, &amp; inſtruct their Children. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, deuout Brethren and Siſters,
<pb facs="tcp:183844:4"/> ſeruants of Ieſus Chriſt, pardon me (vnworthy the name of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) for that theſe many yeares paſt, I haue not written vnto you all in generall, but onely once, to encourage you in the holy Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which our Lord hath called you vnto, and in the battaile which you maintaine againſt the flesh, the world, and the deuill, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the happy waye, and perfect courſe of Penance, which you haue begunne. For if the father, which begetteth one according to the flesh, is ſo bound to bring him vp in his youth in vertue, that if through his fault and want of due correction, and inſtruction, he do amiſſe, great punishment hangeth ouer his head (whereof we haue a lamentable example in Hely the high Prieſt, who for default of his children was punished himſelf with ſuddaine death, and his houſe ouerthrowne and quite deiected) Much more care ought the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Fathers haue, to cherish, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, and encourage their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb facs="tcp:183844:4"/> in the vertuous courſe, which they haue begunne, and to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and reprehend them, if they do otherwiſe, for that moſt ſeuere is the threatning of Almighty God againſt them, if through their negligence any should fal to ruine, ſaying by the mouth of Ezechiel:<note place="margin">Ezec. 34.</note> 
               <hi>That he would require the blood of thoſe which shall perish at the hands of ſuch, as by their negligence were cauſe therof.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though heretofore whilſt your number was but ſmall, I was able by worde and preſence to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, what by writing I omitted to doe, yet now, your holy companie daily encreaſing, and my yeares &amp; ſtrength continually decaying, my purpoſe &amp; deſire is by Gods grace, (and his diuine ayde aſſiſting me) now to accomplish and performe that, wherein I haue hitherto fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and to that end, I haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled this little TREATISE OF PENANCE, for your direction and comfort: to whom, with all ſincere and fathertly affection, I dedicate it, making humble petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:183844:5"/> in my poore prayers, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Sacrifices with my whole hart, to the end I may further you in what poſsibly I can, to winne and procure at laſt the crowne, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for you in heauen, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed you here on earth, at your profeſsion, for your Penance and paines taking, to gaine the fauour of God, which euery good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought alſo chiefly to ſeeke: for I aſſure you, a Chriſtian hath but this one buſineſſe, or at leaſt this ought to be the principal, to learne how to finde fauour before God, ſeeing that to pleaſe him, is the happieſt thing that can come vnto vs: for without this, what are all other things but affliction and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie? But hauing well laboured therein, and accomplished that matter, ther is nothing that should terrifie vs, becauſe hauing Gods fauour, one ought not to care, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all afflictions and paines should fall vpon him. And I feare that one of the cauſes why manie liue, without hauing, or obtayning
<pb facs="tcp:183844:5"/> the fauour of this our Lord and Redeemer, contenting themſelues with the vanities of this world (which by your Rule and holy Order, you are to contemne) is, for that they know not the worth thereof, or the vehement deſire he hath to beſtow it on vs, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe withal, in whom all grace and goodneſſe is comprehended. For who is hee that should perfectly know, that in one thing onely, all goodneſſe is heaped together, but would truely deſire, rather to haue it, then to wander vp and downe, begging of euery creature ſome parcell thereof, and after much paines, to remaine as if he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten nothing? For though he had gotten all the world, yet if hee want the fauour of God, all is as nothing, for that it would nothing at all profite him. Our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt by his holy grace, giue vs his light, that wee may lift vp our eyes to him, and that his loue and fauour may appeare to be ſo worthily accounted of, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:183844:6"/> any feare at all, wee may goe foreward in that happy courſe we haue begun to obtaine it, that wee may giue for it whatſoeuer he will demand of vs in exchange, for who ſoeuer will giue but ſomething for the loue of God, and not all, hath too baſe a conceit of the ſame, and therefore deſerueth to remaine without it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, though in this third order, you are not bound or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſell and giue away all vnto the poor, as in the other two orders they are counſelled to doe, either in deed, or good will at the leaſt: yet all ſuch as will do well, and get Gods grace &amp; his fauour, muſt giue all that they haue, and themſelues withall, wholly vnto God, who did not thinke much to giue himſelfe wholly vpon the Croſſe, for our ſakes.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt giue much, to haue much, and to rejoyce not a little, that wee haue to giue, that which God demandeth for himſelfe, and his honour, thereby to declare our
<pb facs="tcp:183844:6"/> affection vnto him. And if this bee good (as good it is) for all ſortes of people, by farre greater reaſon doth it appertaine vnto you (moſt deere Brethren and Siſters) which after a more particuler maner then others, are his choſen ſeruants, which haue renounced the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the world, to ſerue him in this holy order of Penance.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch, as the naturall inclination and diſpoſition of men is ſuch, that ſeldome or neuer will they willingly vndergoe any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, labour, or paine, vnleſſe they hope thereby to get honour, gaine, or pleaſure; but where there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of any one of theſe, there is no danger ſo imminent, no pain ſo grieuous, nor labour ſo great, but they will voluntarily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, for to obtaine their wished deſire. What danger is there ſo perrilous, but the valiant Souldier will expoſe himſelfe vnto, in hope to atchiue honour? what paine ſo grieuous, but that the voluptous men, and louers of the world, doe
<pb facs="tcp:183844:7"/> ſubject themſelues here vnto, for to obtaine a momentary pleaſure? What toyle and trauell is there ſo great, but that the husbandman will vndertake, for future hope, and vncertaine gaine.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, ſeeing that all other perſons alſo, of what degree or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate ſoeuer, are thus naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyned, and that not onely Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it ſelfe, but the verie name thereof, ſeemeth hatefull vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for want of the knowledge, and due conſideration of the honor, profite, and pleaſure, that it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth man vnto. For that cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I go about to ſet downe your holy order of Penance, or declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Rule and maner of life, which our B. Father S. FRAVNCIS, by the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt, did inſtitute in the yeare of our Lord 1221. for all ſorts of perſons, whoſe deſire was to liue deuoutly in their owne houſes, to flye the pompes of the worlde, and to intende chiefly to the workes of pietie. The more to
<pb facs="tcp:183844:7"/> encourage you in your good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, &amp; to animate others to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your vertuous examples, I deemed it not a miſſe, to take away firſt, that hardneſſe and hatefulnes which ſeemed to many to bee in Penance, by declaring the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie and vtilitie thereof, with the great graces which redound vnto all perſons in generall from it, but eſpecially from this your holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Penance, which foraſmuch as it requireth euery moneth ſome exhortation to be made vnto you thereof: I haue ſet downe here this little Treatiſe, to the end that at ſuch times as you want that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, you might read ſome of theſe Chapters following. And ſeeing that our holy Patrone S. FRAVNCIS, doeth require in his children, an ſpeciall obedience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all others, vnto the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, I as a poore childe of his, do with all humble ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of will, minde and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſubmit not onely this my ſimple collection, and declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:183844:8"/> of your rule, vnto the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and reformation thereof, but in like ſorte, all my actions and thoughts, beſeeching ſweete Ieſus, which is our chiefe Patrone, that this my poore labour may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to his honour and praiſe, &amp; vnto the encreaſe of grace &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in you his deuout children, ſo hoping of your fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable acceptance of good will, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I reſt,</p>

            <head>The Epistle to the Reader.</head>
            <p>GEntle Reader, pondering, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently noting, the great fruits, and manifold helpes, which diuers holy members of the Catholike Church hath in times paſt, and euen vntil this day, do continually receaue from this third holy order, inſtituted by our Seraphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Father, S. <hi>FRANSCIS,</hi> which he, (as teſtifieth S. <hi>BONAVENTVRE</hi>) would haue to be called, the third order of Brothers and Siſters of Penance, for that the way of Penance is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men that deſire to come to heauen, ſo in like ſort this order, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting both the Clargie and Laie people, Virgins and married folkes of both ſexes. I did therefore obtaine
<pb facs="tcp:183844:9"/> from my Superiours, the forme of this Rule in French ſome <hi>17.</hi> yeares past, and ſeeing that it was firſt ordained for all deuout perſons, of what degree ſoeuer, that would vndertake it, I did preſently tranſlate it into our natiue mother tongue, to the intent, it might according vnto the firſt inſtitution, be made common vnto all ſuch zealous perſons, as had any deſire to embrace it: foraſmuch as this Rule and worthy forme of life, being made in a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Countrey (where all vertuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and pious deuotions, are freely practized) doth exhort all followers thereof, to frequent and fulfil diuers holy workes, which many perſons, not well weighing the whole contents of this Rule, and the carefull prouiſion, which our holy Fathers haue made for all perſons of what eſtate, and place, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, haue thought it to be a matter of great difficultie, if not impoſsible to
<pb facs="tcp:183844:9"/> obſerue the contents of this Rule in our Countrey at this time. Wherefore, ſeeing that it was ordained in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Chapter, which was helde last at <hi>Tolledo,</hi> that all Superiours; of the orders of holy <hi>S. FRAVNCIS,</hi> should vſe their beſt meanes, to publish this his third order, in all Prouinces, I (though vnworthy of the place) not long after, being made <hi>Commiſſarie Generall,</hi> of the Prouince of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, deſirous both to fulfill the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the General Chapter, in doing my best indeauour, to publish in our Prouince, this holy order, and in like maner, to take away and make cleere all ſuch doubts and difficulties, as ſeemed to be conteyned in this Rule, did tranſlate it againe out of Latine, verbatim, as it was ſet downe in the Apoſtolical breue, of <hi>NICOLAVS 4.</hi> for the confirming of it, and according to the priuiledge which his Holineſſe
<pb facs="tcp:183844:10"/> graunted, in the <hi>18.</hi> Chapter of this Rule and forme of life, did diſpence, and accommodate it in abſtinences, fastings, and all other auſterities, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the conueniencie, of the perſons, time and place, of our Countrey. But ſeeing afterwards, that the number of Brothers and Siſters, did increaſe in ſuch ſorte, that it was, and would bee hereafter more troubleſome, both to write out large Copies thereof, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one which deſireth it, or to giue vnto each perſon thoſe particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, which was neceſſarie for ſo holy a congregation: I purpoſed to put it into print, and therefore made a more ample declaration thereof, to the intent, that ſuch as I could not conueniently inſtruct in all poynts of this Rule by worde of mouth, they did either doubt of, or were willing to learne, for the perfect obſeruation of this holy eſtate of life; and for their
<pb facs="tcp:183844:10"/> better encouragement therein, I had gathered alſo a short collection of the chiefeſt perfections of this most pious order, and therewithall endeauoured to shew how euery point thereof did take his firme foundation from the holy Scriptures, purpoſing to haue ioyned it, vnto this preaſent Treatiſe. But hauing at length obtained this Rule written in Spanish, with the briefe annotations, of the Reuerend Father, <hi>Commiſſarie General,</hi> of our whole order in theſe partes behi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the the Alpes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I fearing leaſt that this preſent Treatiſe, would altogether mount to a greater volume, then I thought it conuenient for this preſent time, haue left out the collection of the perfection of this Rule, vntill ſome other conuenient oportunitie, and added in ſtead thereof, this Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Fathers Epiſtle, and his annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon this Rule, to the intent
<pb facs="tcp:183844:11"/> that euery one may both ſee, how this Rule is obſerued in Catholike Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and alſo that it is an order much reſpected, and not worne out of request, or like eaſily to be troden downe, ſeeing that all the chiefe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ſuperiours of our order, in the whole world, being aſſembled together, in a general Chapter, were ſo carefull in making a ſpeciall orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, for the publishing and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of it, which cauſed this our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſarie General, not onely to requeſt, but alſo to command all our Prouinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to publish and eſtablish, and vſe all their beſt meanes, for the conſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſo holy a thing, whereby this holy congregation is ſo encreaſed, within this last ten yeares, ſince that commandement was giuen, that not onely the meaner vertuous ſort, but alſo a greater parte of the Nobilitie of <hi>Spaine,</hi> hath and doth daily em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brace
<pb facs="tcp:183844:11"/> and obſerue it moſt ſincerely, being mooued not a little thereunto, by the examples of many worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which did both excell them in many degrees of Nobilitie here in earth, and now much more in heauen; being ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Canonized Saints, others beatified, beſides thoſe honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthy perſons, which for their vertuous deedes, and holineſſe of life, their names are cronacled to their perpetual memorie here in earth, and no doubt to their euerlasting glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in heauen: whoſe names as our forementioned <hi>Commiſſarie,</hi> did place in the end of his little booke, ſo haue I ioyned them in the ende of mine, adding thereunto the name of our moſt vertuous and renowned Queene, <hi>KATHERINE,</hi> mother vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Queene <hi>MARIE,</hi> of happie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, being the onely perſon of great worth, that I can learne to haue bene
<pb facs="tcp:183844:12"/> of this third order in our Countrey, which may as yet be conueniently cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacled. And for as much as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of this holy Rule and forme of life, doe (and must if they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently) ſerue the Saints of all the three orders, which our holy Patron S. <hi>FRANCIS</hi> instituted, I haue (both for their eaſe, and the deuotion of all ſuch as will deuoutly inuocate their helpe) added alſo the commemorations of all thoſe Saints, which imitating the Rules of our Seraphical Father here in earth, do now to his greater glory, and their euerlaſting happines, euioy with him the ſight and company of our heauenly Father, in his glorious kingdome, which as we deſire all to do, ſo I beſeech God of his infinite loue and goodneſſe, to graunt vs all his grace to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne in ſuch ſort as thoſe bleſſed Saints haue done the vanities and pleaſures of this world, that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb facs="tcp:183844:12"/> by their example, through the narrow way of Penance, we may come in the ende, to the happy home, where they now liue in all felicitie, and poſſeſſe eternall bliſſe, with God and all his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Court.</p>

            <head>Certaine Reaſons, to make more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest the dangers which proceede from delay and negligence, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Penance. <hi>CAP. IIII.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE long delay of Penance, bringeth ſuch danger vnto thy ſoule, that there is ſcant any one thing, whereof either the holy Scripture, auncient Fathers, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne writers, haue made more mention, or laboured more carefully to exhort and ſtir vp all men to auoyde and to flye, by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently exerciſing of Penance, then this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay: yet notwithſtanding, ſuch is the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe of our time, that there is nothing which is now made leſſe account of. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I exhort all ſuch as haue a due care and perfect deſire to come to eternall reſt, to take ſome paines in ſeriouſly conſidering theſe foure reaſons here following, and to preuent accordingly in conuenient time, the dangers which hereafter may otherwiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall vnto them.</p>
            <p>The firſt reaſon therefore is, according to the common ſaying, <hi>That as a man liueth, ſo will he Die.</hi> Wherefore as he which hath liued well, doth ſeldome dye ill: ſo of the contrarie ſide, he which hath ſpent his life in lewdneſſe, hardlie maketh a good ende
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:183844:30"/> Wee ſee commonly, that which waies a tree hath continually bended, to that ſide will he ordinarily fall; for if ſome great tree doth crooke and bend all his waight and bowes towardes the left ſide, if this tree be cut downe, without all doubt he wil fal one the left hand; euen ſo, if thou caſt all thy deſires, affections, and thoughts vpon worldly things, and imploy all thy carke and care, whilſt thy life laſteth, onely to get ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, riches, and pleaſure, how should it come to paſſe, that when death shal cut thee downe, thou canſt fall into the right hand of God, &amp; moſt happie companie of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? Woe therefore be vnto them, which leading their liues in vice and ſinne, doe hope to be Citizens of heauen, and haue place in thoſe happie ſeates, for that lot will happen vnto them which they haue alwaies ſought for, and loued in their life. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the chiefe care of euery one ought to be, ſo to liue continually, as he would bee found at the hower of death.

            <p>Thirdly, hee which long deferreth Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, many times by the iuſt iudgement of God, is either ſuddenly preuented by death, and ſo falleth into euerlaſting damnation, or elſe is taken vnawares and oppreſſed with griefe and ſickneſſe, in ſuch ſort, that he forgetteth himſelfe quite,<note place="margin">S.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:183844:32"/> when litle meanes remained in them to doe any thing at all. Wherefore, as they haue liued like bruite beaſts, following their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualities without all reaſon, they doe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily deſerue to die, voyde of all grace, without the Sacraments and Spiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts: which often happeneth vnto them, which would not in time vſe their reaſon in ſeeking of Gods grace, &amp; their owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, but vſed it rather againſt God, and iuſtice in all wickedneſſe. And though they looſe not reaſon, yet are their paines ſo great, that they can then hardly thinke on any thing elſe, as witneſſeth S. GREGORY ſaying.<note place="margin">S. Greg.</note> 
               <hi>VVhen thou art oppreſſed with ſicknes thou canst ſcantly think one any thing elſe, but what thou feeleſt.</hi>

            <p>Fourthly, although a man should do true Penance in the end, in ſuch ſort, that God should forgiue his ſinnes, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:183844:32"/> remaineth a long and hard ſatisfaction to be made in Purgatorie, for the paine due vnto the ſame, which eaſily and in shorte ſpace might, by perfect and liuely Penance, haue here bene accomplished, &amp; the poore ſinner freed both of the offences, and fault of ſinne, and of a great part of the paine due thereunto. Wherefore whilſt we haue time, let our ſtudie be to doe wel, declyning from vice, and willingly and patiently ſuffering all perſecutions, afflictions, and infirmities, that thereby wee may here make ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and be releaſed of the paines due vnto our ſinnes in Purgatorie.<note place="margin">S.

AVGVSTINE conſidering how grieuous is the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinne after this life, beſeeched Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, here to punish him, and to ſpare him afterwards, ſaying: <hi>Lord burne me, cut me here, that thou mayst pardon mee for euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But many there be which doe make litle account to deferre their Penance, and leaue it to be fulfilled and accomplished in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie; and for that the paine is not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, they weigh not greatly how large it be otherwiſe, or how grieuous, hauing onely regard vnto that which is preſent, and looke not to that which is to come: which if they did as duely conſider as they might, and ought to doe, I make no doubt but that the feare of the greatneſſe of the paines of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, would cauſe them willingly to do Penance here. S. AVGVSTINE ſpeaking of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:183844:33"/> the greatneſſe of the paines of Purgatorie, ſaith. <hi>That although it be not eternal yet doth it far paſſe all the paines that euer any man ſuffered or can ſuffer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Aug.</note> A learned and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writer affirmeth, that although by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny light and eaſie meanes, a man may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently make ſatisfaction for a venial ſinne, yet if nothing be to be done or ſuffred for it here, he shall ſuffer far more greater paine in Purgatorie for one venial ſinne not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed for, then S.

               </note> when he was broyled on the Grydion, wherefore it is ſaid in the Decrees, that, No temporal paine is to be compared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the paines in Purgatorie.</p>
            <p>If therefore a man incurreth ſo great danger by not ſatisfying here for a veniall ſinne, which is ſo litle, that though it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to paine, yet ſo ſmall, and ſo eaſily may ſatisfaction be made here for it, that either by compunction, contrition, confeſſion, or other vertuous workes, or holie actions, one may be ſo cleerely clenſed thereof, as though it had neuer bene in him.

For though no man can know aſſuredly, how long, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods iuſtice a man is to bee puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in Purgatorie, for the paine of one mortall ſinne, yet notwithſtanding a learned
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:183844:33"/> and auncient writer ſaith, that it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough, that one should be punished there, for the ſatisfaction of the paine of one mortall ſinne, ſo many yeares as there be dayes in ſeauen yeares:<note place="margin">Decr. <hi>32.</hi> qu. hoe ſanctu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

But though this should be moſt certaine and true, taking it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rigour of Gods iuſtice, yet is his mercie ſo infinite, and his loue ſo great, that he offereth meanes daily vnto all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that will in time accept of his grace, and benig ſorrowful for their ſinnes leaue them, that by good workes, and perfect Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, we may here not onely make ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for them, but alſo winne thereby, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a short paſſage, euerlaſting glorie.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, he which deferreth his Penance vnto the end of his life, which peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be to morrow, though God should graunt him ſo much fauour and grace, truly to do it, yet (vnleſſe the ſatisfaction be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie) can hee not then expect to haue ſo much glorie in heauen, as if he had done it in like ſorte ſooner; for it was not without cauſe that the Eccleſiaſtick ſaide:

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:183844:50"/> includes the deſire of the ſacrament of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which the penitent is bounde to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue finding oportunitie, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any precedent contrition neuer ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For in ſinne thou muſt conſider two things, the one is the offence which thou haſt committed againſt thy Lord: the other is the onely hurt which thou haſt thereby brought vnto thy ſelfe; for thereby thou haſt made thee a bondſlaue to eternal paine in hell. If therefore thou art rather ſorry, and do more repent thy ſelf, for feare of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hel, then for that thou haſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded God; it is moſt manifeſt, that thy pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is more to flye and auoide that, which is againſt thy ſelfe, then that which is againſt God. Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that thou doeſt more loue thy ſelfe, then God. And therefore thy ſinnes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſacrament of penance, shall neuer be remitted, although thou shouldeſt haue the greateſt ſorrow and griefe that might be, vnleſſe thou repent thy ſelfe and be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful alſo, that thou haſt offended God, for God doth more reſpect the cauſe of the griefe, then the greatneſſe thereof, and doth chiefly behold the end, that the ſinner hath in doing of Penance; whereof we haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt examples in the holie Scriptures.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 15 <hi>Reg.</hi> 12</note> SAVL and DAVID were both kings of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and both of them alſo offended, and were in like ſorte both of them reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by two Prophets, and to conclude, both

            <p>EVEN as the goodneſſe of almightie God is ſo infinite, that he turneth all things to the good of mankinde; ſo on the contrarie ſide, the malice of Sathan is ſo great, that there is not any thing ſo good, but that hee will bende all his forces to turne it into euill. Therefore as God by almes deedes bringeth foorth pietie; by Prayer, deuotion; by faſting, continency, &amp;c. ſo quite contrarie, of all thoſe doth the deuill draw foorth, Arrogancie, pride, and a kinde of ſlouthfulneſſe to all other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. And as God, and the deuil are of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie willes, ſo do they bring foorth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie effects; For what is more oppoſite, then Arrogancie and Humility, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil bringeth foorth Arrogancy of vertue, and God produceth Humilitie of ſinne, and Penance from Humilitie, and from perfect penance grace and euerlaſting glorie. The deuil on the other ſide, ſeeketh to procure from penance a contrarie ende, for by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading a man, that penance ſoone purgeth ſinne, and winneth heauen, allureth him to all kinde of vnlawful pleaſures, vnder hope that he shal haue time ſufficient to do pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in the end, that ſo being led away with
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:183844:60"/> this vaine pretence, hee may defer his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion and amendment of life, ſo long, till at the laſt, by the iuſt iudgement of God, hee is preuented, and findeth now no place for Penance. And hauing vainely ſpent the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious time, that God had lent him to gaine eternall glorie, falleth ſuddenly into euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ignominie. But if a mans zeale be ſuch, that the deuill ſeeth that he cannot hinder him from beginning to do timely and true Penance, then doeth he bende all his forces to incite and allure him to take ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and accuſtomed courſes therein, that following either obſtinatlie, or indiſcreetly his owne will, he looſeth therby, both the greateſt parte of his merit, and alſo manie times, growing wearie of the vertue of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, through his owne fault, returneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to his former vices and pleaſures, in worſe ſort for the moſt part, then euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:183844:64"/> women were ſo mooued with his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they were ready to leaue al, &amp; deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to follow him; but our holie Patrone S. FRANCIS ſaid vnto them, you shall not ſo doe, but I will ordaine for your comfort and ſoules health, what you shall take in hand: and then preſently he determined to inſtitute this third ORDER, which is called <hi>Of the Brethren &amp; Siſters of Penance:</hi> for his only intent in inſtituting this Order was, to incite all ſorts of people, ſo to follow the examples of Penance, which our Lord and Maiſter did giue vs, both by word and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that following him here in earth, they might raigne with him in heauen, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto S.

            <p>And in all other matters, S. FRANCIS re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth no more here in Gods behalfe, but what our heauenly Father requireth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>My ſonne giue me thy heart.</hi>

            <p>But all occaſion of ſuch excuſe is taken away, by this that he requireth, no more but our heart, wholly to be giuen vnto him, &amp; not either lent or ſolde, They lend God their hearts, which ſerue him for temporall proſperitie, and when it is taken away from them, then do they with-draw their hearts againe, which before they had giuen vnto him, and of thoſe did the Pſalmiſt ſpeake when he ſaid, <hi>Hee vvill praiſe thee,</hi>

            <p>They onely therefore giue their hearts to God, which out of their meere loue and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to himſelfe, do ſerue him; and this is the ſeruice which God requireth, when he ſaid,<note place="margin">

               <hi>My ſonne giue me thy heart.</hi> Beholde the benignity and prudence of our tender Father, which knowing that loue is the loadſtone of loue, ſeeketh by louing words to draw thy heart &amp; loue to him, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his particular affection towardes thee, ſaying: My ſonne, my ſonne, for whome I haue created heauen and earth and al things that are therein; my ſonne, whom I haue made to mine owne image and likeneſſe; my ſonne, vpon whom I haue appoynted one of my heauenly Court to attend; my ſonne, vnder whoſe feete I haue made the beaſts of the fields, the fowles of the ayre, the fishes of the ſea, and al things ſubiect; my ſonne, whom I haue preſerued &amp; fed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very firſt conception, vntill this preſent day. My ſonne, I ſay for whoſe Redemption I haue giuen my onely begotten Sonne, and my ſelfe with all; my ſonne, for whom the inheritance of the kingdome is prepared: Giue mee thy whole hearte therefore as freely, without any other more principall hopes. This doth our Sauiour teach and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:183844:66"/> exhorte vs vnto, when he ſaith:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 22</note> 
               <hi>Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He therefore which will haue God for his Father, and raigne with him in his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly kingdome, muſt shew himſelfe here to be his true ſonne, in giuing his whole heart, loue and affection vnto him, ſeeing that this is the onely thing which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth for all that, which he hath already giuen, or hereafter promiſed in heauen, which hee sheweth himſelfe to be moſt willing to giue, in that he asketh nothing for it, but what euerie one may eaſilie giue, of what degree, eſtate, or condition ſoeuer he be.</p>
            <p>For the pooreſt man that hath not a penny, may giue his heart as wholly (and loue God as entirely) as the moſt rich and mighteſt king: So the foolish perſon that knoweth not a letter, may as well as the wiſe and learned, the weake and lame, no leſſe then the ſtrongeſt Gyant; and to conclude, the poore Sheepheard which feedeth his sheede, may giue his heart as freelie, and loue God, as deuoutlie, as the Pope or Emperour. For that it is a thing of ſuch great neceſſitie, to giue thy heart wholly to God, and to loue him entirely that without charitie none can come vnto heauen. There are many in heauen, which were very poore, which were weake and ignorant, which could not faſt or giue themſelues to much prayer, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:183844:67"/> there is none there which want the nuptial garment of charitie.</p>
            <p>But if peraduenture this demaund may ſeeme to be ſo hard, that it cannot be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, for that God demanding our whole heart, demandeth there withall our will, in ſuch ſort, that there is nothing left to our owne other affaires. Note I pray you, to the intent you may the more plainely ſee, that this demand is ſo eaſie and ſweet, that any man may yeeld to the fulfilling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This Commandement is affirmatiue, which bindeth alwaies, but not for all times, but in time of neceſſitie: Euen as the Precept of reuerencing our Parents, doeth not binde for alwaies, or at al times, but as occaſion recuireth; ſo likewiſe thou art not bounde alwaies to loue God, but as time and place shal require. For God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth that when the world, the flesh, &amp; the deuil, doe ſet any thing before thine eyes to be loued, then oughteſt thou ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to looſe any ſuch thing, then thou shouldeſt neglect thy duety, or diſpleaſe thy God. He therefore loueth God truely, which wil not for the loue of any Creature diſpleaſe God, but in the meane ſpace, whilſt no occaſion of ſinne is offred, thou maiſt loue all other things ordinatly, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, wife and children; yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, with this implyed condition, that thou haſt thy ſoule alwaies readie to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any torture, torment, or damage, were
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:183844:67"/> it neuer ſo grieuous, rather then for any of them, it should offend mortally. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou maiſt eaſily ſee, the wordes of our Sauiour to be moſt true, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 11</note>

            <p>I haue a little willingly digreſſed, &amp; bene the longer vpon this point, for that the chiefeſt obligation, and moſt principal part of the Vowe of this holie order, is, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the Commandements of God, which burden (if it may be ſo called) being light, there is no other point heauie; eſpecially ſeeing that NICOLAS the 4.

For conſidering that the firſt ground, and firme foundation of all happineſſe, both in this life, and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to come, is the true beliefe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant profeſſion of the Catholike faith, the firſt thing which hee requireth, that with all diligence should be looked vnto, was the ſinceritie of the faith of him which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be receiued into this Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ought to be ſuch, that not onely he should firmely beleeue all ſuch things, as our holy Mother the Catholike Church

So in like ſort, no perſon that is defamed, or hath bene iuſtly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended or punished by publike iuſtice, can be admitted; for that the Reception of any ſuch perſon (though now penitent) which is but priuate, yet his offence hauing bene publike, would breed ſcandal to the whole order, and diſcouragement vnto ſuch as might be deſirous to be thereof, thinking that if the Congregation were ſo perfect as they ought to be, they would not admit ſo vnperfect a perſon, which hath bene defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, into their company. It was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without iuſt cauſe, that in the olde law it was ſtrictly forbidden, that he which had any defect or ſpot, should not offer bread vnto God, neither might come vnto his Miniſterie, if he were blind or lame, or had any other notable marke or defecte.

               <p>Theſe are the chiefe bonds and obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which our Holy Father (as you haue heard in the Rule) called Burdens.

He had this Obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in ſuch Recommendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; held it to be ſo neceſſary for the confirmation of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; Congregation in all holines, fame, &amp; good name, that whoſoeuer should goe againſt it, and be incorrigible and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, he commandeth in the 16. Chap. of the Rule: and for the better confirmation thereof, repeateth againe in the 19. that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thrice admonition, the Viſitor should caſt him out of the companie of this Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie, and publish it afterwardes in the Congregation, thereby shewing that euery one ought ſo to bende all his endeauours, to the obtaining of that heauenly reward, which is promiſed for their labours, that they should not ſuffer any one amongſt them, which either by worde, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, should be any hinderance vnto them.</p>
               <p>But it happeneth many times, that euen as the Explorators or Spies (which the children of Iſrael, ſent to diſcouer the lande of promiſe, which by Almightie God was promiſed vnto them) being timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous &amp; feareful perſons, ſeing ſome thing that ſeemed through their cowardlines, to be matter of difficultie; did endeauour to diſcourage the Iſraelites, from attempting that iourney, by telling them that the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:183844:84"/> difficulty of the way was great, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſtronge Gyants, their fight hard, and doubtfull, ſo many indeuout perſons, and ſome inexperienced Ghoſtly Fathers alſo in matters of perfection, doe no leſſe goe about ſometimes to diſcourage many ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous perſons, and deuout children of God, from vndertaking this happy courſe of Penance, which leadeth to that heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Countrey, and happie home of endleſſe happineſſe, alleadging many ſuppoſed dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties; as the breeding of ſcruples in their timerous conſciences, the endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereby of their health, and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from other neceſſary affaires, and want of ſtrength and abilitie to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in ſuch ſort, &amp; ſuch a courſe of life, where they may ſee ſo many burdens, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, and paineful bondes; as to faſt, pray, riſe earlie, often to goe to Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as oft to receaue that moſt holie Sacrament of the Aultar, to viſite the fick, relieue the poore, bury the dead, auoyde ſtrife, ſeeke peace, depriue themſelues of ſenſual delights, refraine from oathes and vaine wordes, make dailie ſatisfaction for their offences, and doe ſuch other acts of Penance, as are of themſelues painefull. But little do they ſee or conſider as men altogether in expert, either of the inwarde feruent affection, of deuout ſeruants of God, where with all their hearts being wholly enflamed, doe little feele and eaſily
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:183844:84"/> beare theſe light burdens, or the manifolde benefites, which proceeding from theſe burdens themſelues, doe render all theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, moſt ſweete and pleaſant to be done, nor yet the greatneſſe of the rewarde, promiſed for the accomplishing of them, which being no leſſe then the life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, doe make the deuout Brethren and Siſters, not onely to be moſt prompt, ready and diligent in keeping of all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, as by vow they binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues thereunto, but alſo it prouoketh them with ioy and delight to doe al maner of good workes, not onely in thoſe which are commanded by Gods lawes, but ſuch alſo as are onely commended vnto their free will by his Counſelles, being incited thereunto, by theſe holy ordinances of S. FEANCIS, which by the inſpiration of the holie Ghoſt, did ordeyne them for their comfort, both here and euerlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
               <p>Wherefore as IOSVA and CALER did giue encouragement vnto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael to goe forwarde to the lande of promiſe by proteſting, not onely that the Countrey was beautiful and fruitfull, but alſo that the winning and poſſeſſion thereof, would be both eaſie and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their wishes. So by Gods grace, and holie aſſiſtance, I will (imitating the example of IOSVA) endeauour to giue encouragement, vnto deuout ſoules, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:183844:85"/> vertuous perſons (the louing children of God) to go forward vnto that land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and holie Order of Penance, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that not onely it promiſeth and yeeldeth great profit in this life, to thoſe which vndertake it; and far greater after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, vnto thoſe which obſerue it, and perſeuer therein, but alſo that the poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and keeping thereof, will in like ſort be eaſie, and agreeable vnto their wishes, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great benefite, which proceedeth from euerie one of theſe bandes, which ſeeme to be burdens.</p>
               <p>As concerning therefore the profite which is promiſed vnto this holy Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and reaped therein; it is ſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great, that hardly can their eſtate and calling, expect greater, either for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent momentarie life, or for that other, which neuer shall haue ende, as appeareth plainely, in that moſt auncient forme of their Profeſſion, where the Prelate or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor, which receaueth them thereunto, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that General Abſolution (which the Supreame Paſtors of the Church haue granted vnto them, at their firſt entrance) doth abſolue them, not onely from their ſinnes, but from the paines alſo of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, due vnto all thoſe, which vntil that time they may haue committed, reſtoring them (if they themſelues do not put a barre and let vnto grace) vnto that ſtate of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, wherein they were firſt baptized,

               <p>Thirdly, The ashe colour, or graynes of apparell, is to put them in minde, that as from earth they came, ſo to durt and ashes they muſt returne: and that hauing alway that colour of death before their eyes, they may thereby be mooued to dye vnto the vanities of the worlde, that they may liue vnto God; or by the whitenes of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, (or petticotes) they may be ſtirred vp to be mindefull of that brightnes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie of life, which their calling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, that their conuerſation may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto that which their habit ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth: for this more mortifyed, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinde of Religious Habite, ought to ſeeme as as a bridle, to pull them backe from doing any vnciuil or vndecent deed; and by their burial in their Churches

               <p>Fourthly, by abſtaining from banquets, Courts, daunces, and other vanities, they are made the more apt to receaue diuine comforts, and heauenly conſolations, which God doth neuer impart vnto thoſe which giue themſelue vnto worldly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes and pleaſures: God did not giue his Manna from heauen, vnto the children of Iſrael, as long as there remained any of the meale of Aegypt amongſt them.</p>

               <p>OVR Holie Father, NICHOLAVS the 4. although as chiefe Paſtor of the Church, he had a general care ouer his whole charge, yet hauing bene a religious man and General (as I ſaid before) of our whole order; reteyning ſtill his auncient loue thereunto, doeth shew a particular affection, vnto this holy Order of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: Whereof ſeeing that manie of them were entred into Monaſteries of their owne, and had made three eſſential vowes of Religion, to the intent, that as true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, perſons, they might haue a perfect forme of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing in the 3. cha. of this Rule ſet downe, a religious forme of their habits; doeth now here in the beginning of this Chapter, preſcribe for them moſt ſpecially, a moſt perfect maner of religious diet, both for their abſtinence and faſting. Wherefore in religious houſes, of this order, and alſo ſuch perſons as liue either ſo priuately to themſelues, or in ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as no man noting them with ſo much ſingularitie, in their diet, be ſcandalized thereat, doe ſtrictly keepe this abſtinence, yet notwithſtanding, in this Countreye nowe, where the keeping of Mondaies &amp; Wedneſdaies, in this ſorte might breede ſome ſcandal, the deuout Brethren and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:183844:125"/> Siſters, are freede from keeping them here in this manner, by the leaue, which this foreſaid NICOLAAS the 4. giueth in the 18. chapter of the Rule, vnto the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the places, or Viſitors, to diſpenſe vpon any lawful cauſe (when they shall ſee it expedient) with all the Brethren and Siſters, in abſtinence, faſtings, and other auſterities. Yet neuertheleſſe, I counſell houshoulders (where they may conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently keepe the Wedneſdaies) with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, &amp; the Mondaies, alſo to vſe ſome reſtraints in their diet, either abſtayning from thoſe meates which are moſt pleaſing to their taſte, or at the leaſt (ſetting ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſitie aſide) to take a more ſparing dyet then on other daies: and inſteede of ſtrict faſting, to redeeme it with almes deedes or prayer, ſaying at the leaſt (if ſickneſſe doe not hinder them) fiue <hi>Pater noſters</hi> and <hi>Aues,</hi> in all ſuch daies as they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently faſt: for although it was not the intention of S.

                  <p>IT is a thing vſually practiſed, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish three degrees of thankefulneſſe; one is to acknowledge in heart the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite receiued; the ſecond is to praiſe the ſame, and confeſſe it in wordes; the thirde is, to recompence it in deeds, according to the abilitie of him which hath receaued it; and ſeeing that our abilitie is ſo ſmall, that it is not able to requite the leaſt parte of the great goodneſſe, and infinite bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, which God doeth dailie beſtow one vs, we should be much too blame, if wee did not bende all our forces, and endeuour with heart, woorde, and deede, to requite them in what wee may, which our louing Father, S. FRANCIS wel conſidering, and knowing in like ſorte, that amongſt the dailie benefits, which God ſo liberally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth vnto vs for our bodies, one is the food wherby we liue, &amp; nature is ſuſteined To the intent therefore that the Brethren, and Siſters, of this holie order of Penance, which endeauour thereby, to make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for all former negligences, should not now by vnthankfulneſſe, commit any newe offence, ordeyneth that for thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing vnto God, for that which through his goodneſſe, they are then to receaue, they should both before Dinner and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:183844:129"/> Supper, ſay one Pater noſter, at the leaſt: For if no other Catholike Grace be ſaide, and that they themſelues cannot ſaye one, then muſt they in priuate and heartie maner, repeate one Pater noſter, as wel to shew themſelues thankfull vnto God, as alſo to inuocate his diuine grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlie benediction, from whence procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth our chiefeſt ſuſteynca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e:<note place="margin">

Our life truely doeth not depende vpon the common vſe of naturall things, but vpon the benediction, and will of God, For if it pleaſe him (although naturall things doe neuer ſo much repugne) he wil ſuſtaine and feede his ſeruants. He brought out of the harde ſtone,<note place="margin">

                  <p>That it is a thing lawful for married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by mutual conſent, to vowe chaſtity: the example, of many holy and bleſſed Saints, which haue ſo vowed and wrought manie miracles, both in their life, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doe make it ſo manifeſt, that no man can iuſtlie denie it. S.

                  <p>The onely and chiefeſt reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may not be lawful for a man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and vowe continencie is, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing married, hee hath not power of his owne bodie, and no man can giue that which is anothers, againſt his will, but
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:183844:134"/> this cauſe ceaſeth, and is taken away, when the vowe is made by mutual conſent.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe three ſortes,<note place="margin">Amb de vid.</note> of continencie &amp; chaſtitie, ſpeaketh S. AMBROSE, ſaying: <hi>VVee are taught, that the vertue of chaſtitie is triple, the one of married perſons, the ſeconde of VViddowes, the third of Virgins, for vve do not ſo much extoll the one, as to exclude the others. We praiſe therefore virginitie in ſuch ſorte, that vve doe not reiect vviddovves, &amp; vvee reuerence vviddovves in ſuch maner, that due honour is reſerued vnto marriage.</hi>

To doe any good thing by vowe, is bettet and mote pleaſing vnto God, then that which is done without it.

They therfore which vow virginitie, not only doe gaine (as wee haue ſaid) that their act is more excellent and pleaſing vnto God, but alſo do arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt the aſſaults of the deuil, and humaine frailty &amp; mutability: for men in thoſe things wherunto they are bound, by the bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the law, although they be good &amp; profitable, yet doe they eaſily change their purpoſe, aſwel by the inſtigation of the deuil, as by their owne mutability and inconſtancy; wherefore we ſee that in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine affaires, oathes are oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, wherby the will &amp; mind may be ſo tied, that they may not eaſily be changed; happy therfore is that band which keepeth mans wil ſtable &amp; conſtant; &amp; maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more gratious in the ſight of God, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deuout perſons which are not bound.</p>

               <p>VNTO the ſtate of perfection, is required an abſtraction and aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the minde, from all thoſe things, whereby a man is hindred, that hee cannot wholly giue himſelfe to the ſeruice of God. And for as much as in this vale of miſerie, amongſt all other things, there is no greater impediment, then the care of worldly goods; wherefore to the intent, that by a prouident fore-ſight, this dailie carefull care, and the great hinderance, which commeth thereby, may be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. S. FRANCIS doth here ordeyne, that they which may conueniently, ought with ſpeed, to ſetle their eſtate, and make their wil, and though he doth not require ſuch haſte herein, that they muſt do it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their entrance into this Order of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, yet notwithſtanding, conſidering the hinderance and dangers, which come by lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g deferring, he doth exhorte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make it within three moneths after, at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt, leaſt he should die (ſaith he) inteſtate or without will. S. FRANCIS did preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that whoſoeuer did enter into this third order, if he were then ſicke and did
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:183844:158"/> it to enioy the greate benefites which are to bee obtained herein, at the hower of death, would make preſentlie all prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for it, knowing that ſickneſſe is the ſpeedie meſſenger of God, to inuite all perſons to make preſent repayre vnto him: But if otherwiſe they were at their admiſſion into this holie Order, in perfect health, he did know by dailie experience, that ſuch is the feruour of all perſons, at the abandoning of worldlie pleaſures, and returning vnto God by true loue, and ſincere pennance, that if any ſickneſſe or danger should ſoone happen after, they would as quickly make themſelues ready for whatſoeuer God should pleaſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of them, but as time groweth on, ſo deuotion oftentimes waxeth colde, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whileſt feruour laſteth, hee requireth that they should deſpoſe of their goods, and ſettle their eſtate, and not to deferre the making of their will any longer then three moneths at the moſte, yeelding this reaſon for it, Leaſte they should dye inteſtate, and thereby, not onelie depriue their poore ſoule of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte which it expected, and otherwiſe might haue had, but inſteede thereof, heape thereon great paines, and manie heauie curſes. For ſuch is nowe, the greedy deſire of worldly goods, that a great many ſeeke to catch what they can, wherby it ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hapneth, that not only the ſoul of the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:183844:159"/> departed, is forgotten in ſuch ſorte, that the memorie thereof perisheth with the ſound. But therewithall, brotherlie loue and true friendship is ſo broken, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and couetuouſneſſe poſſeſſeth in ſuch ſorte the hearts of manie, that charitable and good dealing, hath no place therein, when extreamitie of law, yea if forgerie and periurie may ſometimes preuaile: And whereas, if the diſeaſed, had well diſpoſed in time of his eſtate, not onely should haue reaped the benefite of the good deedes which he had done, but alſo haue bene partaker of all which should be done here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, by his good example vnto the worlds ende. Nowe for his negligence, not onely is he depriued of that great benefite, which by his diligence he might haue obtained, but ſeeing that it is a Maxime, that hee which giueth the cauſe of ſinne, is partaker of the offence. And he which gaue the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the hurt, ſeemeth to haue giuen the hurt it ſelfe. Wherefore without the greater mercie of God, he shal be punished for all the offences, which his negligence, in deſpoſing of his eſtate in time, gaue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions vnto his heyres, or poſſeſſors of his goods to doe, and worthely dooth deſerue to be forgotten of others, which had ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle care of himſelfe, as to dye inteſtate and without a will, and not ſetled his goods in ſome ſort, for the good of his ſoule, which muſt render a moſt ſtrict account for the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:183844:159"/> good deedes, which he omitted to doe, when he might haue performed them.</p>
               <p>Iuſt cauſe therefore, had our prudent Father, to admonish his children and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, not to prefer the ſetling of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, but to diſpoſe of all their buſineſſe, in ſuch ſorte, that they may alwaies liue in that ſtate of life, wherein they may bee readie and willing, to render their ſoule vnto God, and not to deferre a matter of ſo great importance, leaſt by ſuddaine and vnſuſpected, or at leaſt vnprouided death, which by diuers waies doe happen, often thoſe aforeſaid hurts and hinderances doe fall to their lot: For though there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more certaine then death, yet notwithſtanding, nothing more vncertaine then the hower thereof, as witneſſeth S. BERNARD, ſaying, <hi>In humaine affaires,</hi>

                  <hi>what is there more certaine then death, and vvhat can be found more vncertaine, then the hower thereof.</hi> For as the Eccleſiaſtick ſaith: <hi>A man knoweth not his ende,</hi>

                  <hi>A man vvill giue skinne for skinne, and all that he hath for his life.</hi> From hence proceedeth the willing ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and enduring, of ſo manie bitter potions, sharpe medicines, and great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, for the conſeruation thereof. Wherefore, Saint FRANCIS, to take the greateſt occaſions of feare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie, exhorteth the Brethren and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteres, to ſtande ſo well prouided for Death, that as it is fearefull vnto others which are vnprouided, ſo it may be moſt comfortable vnto thoſe, which haue made due preparation for it.</p>
               <p>If the ſafe arriuing of a Shippe vnto a happie Porte, after cruell Tempeſtes of the Sea, is moſt gratefull vnto thoſe which haue ſayled therin: If the returning home into a mans owne Countrey, bee moſt pleaſant vnto Pilgrimes, and if vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch as haue bene banished, it is a thing moſt wished for, after a long exile, to returne vnto his natiue ſoyle, how ioyfull

               <p>Let worldlings then, and louers of the world, feare death, but let vs reioyce to dye, which paſſe by death to immortalitie.

S. Francis moſt earneſtly
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:183844:162"/> exhorteth his chilhren &amp; followers, which haue power to make a will, to make it in ſuch time, that they may, partly, if not who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſee the performing therof the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and not to leaue the kingdome of heauen to be purchaſed by others for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but to do their beſt endeauours to purchaſe it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in this life, which is the time of meriting, as the other is, the place of rewarding. Now is the time that the kingdome of heauen is to be bought, wherefore ſome to purchaſe it, giue al their goods for it, as many religious perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s do, but ſpecially the two firſt orders of our holy Patrone, S.

Many one doeth complaine of the badnes of their ſeruants, but doe little regard that their owne neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and euil examples, are the chiefe cauſe thereof. Wherefore S. FRANCIS, to take away the occaſion of euil in both, perſwadeth the Maiſters to be mindfull to exhort his familie and ſeruants to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, not by wordes onely, but by example, for that his wordes will little preuaile, whoſe examples teach farre the contrarie: For as children doe looke vnto

S.

And therefore, not onely to heare Maſſe dailie, as the rule requireth, that they should, if they may conueniently, but alſo where two or three do remaine in a houſe togeather, to aſſemble themſelues once euerie moneth, when they may moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently, to performe as much as lyeth in them, of what is here ordained, both for the good of themſelues, and of the whole congregation, knowing that their prayers shal be ſooner heard, and they aſſembled togeather, obtaine that, which one alone should not, according to that ſaying of S.

               <p>In the Primitiue Church, liberallitie did ſo flourish, and waxed ſo ſtrong to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wordes the poore, that it ſeemed not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient vnto any Chriſtian, if hee gaue in almes onely, what he could wel ſpare, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he beſtowed alſo euen of thoſe things which were partly neceſſary for the ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his owne life.

               <p>Although this notable charitie of the Prophet, was ſo pleaſing and acceptable before God, that euen in this preſent life, he rewarded his poſteritie for it: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, S.

And for as much as he did ſee, according to the ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>That iniquitie did abounde, and charitie grew colde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> The more to ſtirre vp the brethren and ſiſters to charitie and almes giuing, did shew how their almes should be beſtowed, and by whom, that is, the Prieſt which ſaieth the Maſſe, by the aduice of the Miniſter, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times might happen not to be a Prieſt (as firſt of all the Miniſter of the order it ſelfe was not) but onely a Lawyer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

               <p>And for aſmuch as charitie beginneth with it ſelfe, therefore chiefe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to be had, to the reliefe of their owne brethren and ſiſters, oppreſſed with pouerty or ſickneſſe: which amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſolations, which this holy order doeth yeeld, this is one of the leaſt, that what aduerſitie ſoeuer, should by Gods holy permiſſion, fal vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the reſt of their brethren, are bound to haue a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care, to relieue ſuch as remaine in the order.

And for the better enabling of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to do this charitable deed, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the ſecond chapter of this rule, that none should be admitted, but ſuch as were either out of debt, or had ſufficient to diſcharge it: and towardes the latter ende of the rule, he ordaineth in like ſort, that if any should be faulty, in ſpending their goods riotuouſly, or commit any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notorious and manifeſt faults, and after thrice admonition, remaine incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible and diſobedient; they are to be caſt out of the companie, by the viſitor, with the aduice of the Miniſter, and ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete brethren, that the good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous brethren may be the more honored, and better prouided for.</p>

               <p>Although moſt commonly there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which doth more mooue, then the examples which are ſet dailie before our eyes, in ſo much that it is an auncient and common ſaying, that, <hi>According to the kings example, the vvhole vvorld doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſelfe:</hi> yet now in theſe our lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble times, mens harts are ſo hardened, and they ſo prone to all kinde of vice, that an euill example, is as it were a law vnto all men, but if it tende vnto vertue, few will follow it, but looke onely vnto their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate profite and commoditie: wherefore the more to draw the hearts of men vnto charitie, in almes giuing, I wil endeauour to ſet downe the priuate profite and vtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which redoundeth vnto al men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it.</p>
               <p>The firſt commoditie therefore is, that almes doeth after a certaine manner, make God himſelfe debtor, and as it were ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant vnto the Almes-giuer, as may bee plainely gathered, out of theſe two teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies

For that this perſon, by this deede of charitie, lendeth vnto God: What is there I beſeech you, that can be worthie of greater eſtimation, then to haue God his debtor? Or what can be more excellent, or better to bee deſired, then to haue in our power, the meanes to obtaine the mercie of God, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may haue aboundance of his mercy? without all doubt, the almes-giuer hath this meanes in his owne handes, ſeeing that out Lord ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for they shal obtaine mercie.</hi>

               <p>Now would I willingly aske of thee, doeſt thou beleeue theſe teſtimonies of the Scripture or no. If thou doeſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them, thou art no chriſtian: ſeeing that thou beleeueſt not, and giueſt not credit vnto the wordes of Chriſt: if thou ſayeſt that thou beleeueſt, then of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, thou muſt confeſſe that when thou gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt

               <p>If thou therefore beleeueſt it to be ſo, why art thou then ſo ſparing &amp; niggardly in giuing almes, when thy faith telleth thee, that in diſtributing it, the ſame will inrich thee more and more?

If the birdes of the ayre, which know not God, doe not want, how should true Chriſtians then be forgotten? how should Chriſt forget them, which feedeth himſelfe being hungrie? For hee doeth acknowledge that which thou doeſt vnto one of the leaſt of his, thou doeſt it vnto himſelfe: howe will he denie thee earthlie goods, which graunteth liberally heauenly treaſures? how will he refuſe to giue thee a cruſt of bread, or a little water, which powred out his pretious blood &amp; life for thee? Wherefore all this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, how commeth it to paſſe, that thou enioying the name of a Chriſtian, doeſt not truſt and beleeue the words of Chriſt? Confeſſe therfore the trueth, ſay that thou haſt no excuſe, and shew plainely that it is thy miſerable couetouſneſſe, which is cauſe thereof. But there are many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans nowe, in this our vncharitable age, which will not departe from their goods, vntill ſuch time as they ſee that death is ſo neere at hande, that of force they muſt leaue them, &amp; then ſuch as before would not, neither for the loue of God, or feare of diſpleaſure, giue during their life any ſmall almes, now death, ſometimes cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to leaue very much to bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for them.

            <p>The health of bodie, is the chiefeſt and moſt excellent good amongſt al temporall things, wherefore he which is depriued of his health, wanteth the greateſt good; therefore he vſeth greater mercie, which viſiteth the ſicke, then he which otherwiſe feedeth the hungry: for with good health. all other bodilie euils, are more eaſily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated; and without it, what is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt or richeſt mans life, but miſery: when thou ſeeſt therefore, any ſicke perſon, let thy pietie (for the loue of him which had ſo great compaſſion vpon the ſicke) bee ſuch, that thou maiſt ſay with S.

And ſeeing that Chriſt had ſo great a care of the ſicke, if thou wilt not follow him in the like, thou art not worthie to be any of his, for that charitie truely doth not shine clearer, and shew it ſelfe more perfectly, then in the viſitation and care of the ſicke: becauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the miſeries of the world, as hungar, thirſt, heate and colde, pennury &amp; weariſomneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is none that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of more commiſſeration, pittie, and helpe, then the ſicke perſon: Whereupon, a certaine deuout and learned Religious perſon ſaid, that he did more merit in one day, which did helpe, ayde, and ſerue the ſicke perſon, then he which faſted a whole yeare: yea God doth reward them here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo temporally: whereof wee haue exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in holy DAVID, which helping that poore ſicke Egyptian, of him hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, where the Analithites were, &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned victorie, and hee which was cruell towardes the ſicke perſon, for rewarde of his crueltie, loſt the victorie, and was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken captiue.</p>
            <p>How great merit it bringeth to a man after this life, may plainely be ſeene by this onely, that our Lord wil reproach vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the damned, that he was ſicke, and they did

<pb n="412" facs="tcp:183844:204"/> and ſeeing that ſickneſſe is a meſſenger of death; nowe ought hee to be carefull to make ſome ſatisfaction, and be ſorrowfull for the very leaſt offences; for that a great ſinne, as theft, murder, rapine, &amp;c. doeth not ſo ſoone draw and leade vs into hell, as others which ſeeme to be leſſe, doe: for the heynouſneſſe of a great offence, doeth ſo terrifie vs, that wee come, ſoone to the knowledge thereof; whereby it commeth to paſſe, that we do preſently penance for it: But the ſinnes of leſſer note, into which we fall dailie, and whereunto for that we think the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be ſmall, we take no regarde: theſe I ſay are they, which with a ſwift courſe, make vs runne into etenall perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Murmuration, detractation, or ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing, and ſecret whiſpering, by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie, the good fame and name of our nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, which are now ſo commonly vſed in ordinarie talke, that we little regarding ſuch ſmall matters (as wee take them to be) do no penance for them, and ſo by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, wee runne head-long into hell.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, God of his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and no leſſe deſire of the ſaluation of ſuch as ſerue him, doeth ſeldome punish their ſinne with ſuddaine death, but as a token of his loue towardes them, doeth ſende ſome lingering ſickneſſes, thereby to bring them both to the knowledge of themſelues, and of God in like ſort, and to

               <p>But here ſome queſtion may be made, from whence should ariſe this common goods to be in this ſorte applyed, ſeeing that in the chapter precedent, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly going before, mention is made of the almes to be giuen monethly; it is there declared, howe it should bee beſtowed, whereby there ſeemeth nothing to be left to raiſe any ſumme, to make a common purſe for the reliefe of the ſicke and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: Truely, God fordid that any man should thinke ſo vnreuerently of Saint FRANCIS, that hee which had receaued
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:183844:207"/> from God ſuch heauenly light, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie diuine reuelations from aboue, that he often-times did know and declare the verie hidden ſecrets, of the hearts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, as holie S.

               <p>Wherefore certainely S. FRANCIS, a true louer of the poore, as in the precedent Chapter, he did ſet an order for their preſent reliefe; ſo in like ſorte, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined, that the Miniſter should prouide for the brethren and ſiſters in ſicknes, did iuſtly iudge that they would not be ſo void of diſcretion, ſeeing that the almes was to be giuen by their aduiſe; but that it should be ſo giuen, that continually ſome thing might bee kept, to performe that which is required to be done in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, aſwel for the dead, as for the liuing: for his deſire was, that no leſſe care should be had of the brethren and ſiſters, after their departure, then in their life time.
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:183844:207"/> And therefore he ſaieth, <hi>If the ſicke perſon paſſe out of this preſent life, let warning bee giuen, &amp;c.</hi> I would with ſilence haue paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ouer this place, ſeeing that it is a thing which can very ſeldome or hardly at all be now practiſed in our countrey, were it not to make manifeſt vnto thee, that ſuch was the prouident care, of our holie Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone, in all the workes of mercie, which he ordeyned, that the Brethren and ſiſters should dailie exerciſe, as occaſion was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, that he did aſmuch, if not more, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde the good and merite, of the dooer thereof, both in this life, and after, as of him to whom it should be done: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as in ſetting downe that, <hi>if the ſicke partie dyed, that warning should be preſently giuen vnto all the Brethren and Siſters, then in the Cittie or place, that they might bee careful to be preſent at the funeral, and not to departe from thence, vntill all the office be ended, and the bodie buried:</hi> Hee greatly deſired, that the poore ſoule of the diſcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, might preſently haue all comfort by their prayers, both for the multitude of them, being all aſſembled togeather, for that intent, and alſo for the longenes of the time, in that they were not to departe vntil the offiee be ended: and for the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentneſſe of deuotion, which the preſence of the dead bodie would moue them vnto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from whom they were not to depart, vntill it were buried, the ſoule might the ſooner
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:183844:208"/> be deliuered, from the Paine of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie.</p>
               <p>So in like ſort, no ſmall benefits do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound vnto them all, for this piety shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto the dead perſon, by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and aſſiſtance, at his burial: For firſt it is a ſpeciall meanes, to preſerue thee from ſinne, engraffing in thy minde, by thy preſence, at this worke of mercie, in burying the dead, the memorie of death, then which nothing is more profitable or effectual, to preſerue thee from falling into ſinne, as witneſſeth the Wiſeman, ſaying, <hi>Remember the laſt things, and thou shalt neuer offend:</hi> Therefore S. FRANCIS [as I ſaid before) willeth thee to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent perſonally at the buriall of thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſeeing him layd into his graue, thou shouldeſt foorthwith remember thy ſelfe to be mortal, aſſuring thy ſelfe, that thou art to follow him in like maner by death, and to iudgement alſo, according to that of the Eccleſiaſticke, ſaying: <hi>Be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of my iudgement, ſo shall thine be alſo: vnto me yesterdaie, &amp; vnto thee to morrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This memorie of death is therefore a moſt ſinguler remedie, both to preſerue from ſinne, and to bridle the appetites of our flesh, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we do rightly vnderſtand, by the preſident of the dead perſon, layde in the graue, before our face, that this our bodie alſo shall be turned into wormes-meate, and ashes: It caſteth colde water
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:183844:208"/> into the fire of our burning appetites and cooleth much, and extinguisheth al our hotte and inflamed concupiſcences: Saint GREGORIE ſaieth, <hi>The ſepulchres and graues doe shew what is the ſubſtance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine flesh, and there is nothing vvhich doeth more tame the vvanton deſires there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then that euerie one conſider, that this vvhich he novv loueth, what it vvil be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death.</hi> The memorie of death ſo fixed hereby in thy minde, will make thee to contemne quickly, the vanities and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts of the worlde, and all things that might hinder the ſeruice of God; for eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The life therefore of a wiſe man, is the dailie meditation of death: wherefore the Eccleſiaſticke doeth admonish vs moſt notablie, ſaying, <hi>If a man hath liued manie yeares, and hath bene merrie and pleaſant in them all, he ought to remember the darke time, and the dayes of manie, which when they shal come, al that is past, vvill be accuſed and blamed of vanitie.</hi> Life ſeemeth faire, vntill death come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it, but thou muſt, if thou wilt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecure, expect the other parte of thy time, which if thou keepe well in thy minde, thou shalt neuer bee deceaued with the falſe lies and vanities of this worlde, but rather thou wilt cleaue vnto
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:183844:209"/> God, and ſerue him more religiouſly. God commanded that the feathers of the birdes, which were offered vnto him in Sacrifice, should be caſt into the place of ashes, to the eaſt ſide; thereby inſinuating that by riches, honours, health, nobilitie: men are lifted vp as high as a birde with her feathers. But our Lord would haue thee caſt all thoſe things into the place of ashes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the graue, whereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently thou mayeſt ſee thy beginning to be no other but ashes, and from ashes, &amp; into ashes muſt returne. Truely if thou wouldeſt bring all thy vanities &amp; worldly honours, wherewith thou goeſt puffed vp, into the burying and laying into the earth, thou wouldeſt eaſilie contemne them all, and eſteeme them for nothing, and ſoone leaue them for the good of thy ſoule.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, by the very deede it ſelfe, in burying the dead, thou doeſt both great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly merit, and shalt finde fauour at Gods handes for it, who fauoureth greatly thoſe which doe exerciſe themſelues in ſuch workes of mercie and pietie.

               <p>Amongſt many comforts, which this holie Order doeth affoord, truely this is one of the principall, to bee aſſured of helpe, when they ſtande in moſt neede, not being able to ayde or relieue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: Wherefore holie IOBE ſpeaking, as it were in the perſon of the poore ſoule in Purgatorie, in great want, and penurie of comfort, earneſtly crauing for helpe and compaſſion ſaith: <hi>Haue pittie on me, haue pittie on me, at least you which are my friends, for that the hande of the Lord hath touched me.</hi>

Wherefore let all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Guardians be careful, that in euerie Couent, they appoynt Viſitors and other Miniſters, as the Rule requireth: inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting well vnto them the diligence which they ought to haue in the keeping and augmentation of it, in ſuch ſorte that the Brethren and Siſters exerciſe themſelues in the workes of Charitie, and good of their owne ſoule, and their neighbours, eſchewing all kinde of ſuperfluity and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſſe, that they be not thereby cauſe of moleſtation and diſtraction, one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p>EVEN as in the firſt Chapter of this Rule, S. FRANCIS was ſo careful in the reception of the brethren
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:183844:217"/> and ſiſters into this Congregation, that hee ſtrictly prohibited, and forbideth, that no Hereticke or any ſuſpected of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie or diffamed should be receaued, and if it should be found out, that any ſuch had bene receaued, the Miniſters should with all ſpeede, deliuer him ouer vnto the Inquiſition, to be punished, that the reſt of the Brethren might be preſerued from corruption.</p>
               <p>So now here, to the intent that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters should bee the more carefull to looke diligently, both vnto their owne actions, and vnto thoſe committed vnto their charge, ordeyneth that they shall come altogeather, vnto ſome Religious place or Church (which may be priuate vnto themſelues for that inſtant time) where not onely the Brethren and Siſters, but alſo the Miniſter himſelfe is to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited and corrected or depoſed, if hee be found faulty, either in his life, or executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his charge.</p>
               <p>Tertullian in his Apologie, reporteth that, <hi>in the Primitiue Church, where all perfection flourished amongst the christians, they were wont in that time of perſecution, to come togeather in the night, in the churches of the holy martyrs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both to praiſe God, and to praye for the common good, as for peace for the Emperour, for the ſtate of the church, and other thinges: and alſo to treate and conferre, of the affaires of Religion,

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore S.

               <p>But alſo inſtituted this yearely viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and corrections, that hereby at the leaſt, all that was amiſſe, might be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For as a Clocke, be it neuer ſo good
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:183844:218"/> or well ſet, muſt be wounded vp twice a day at the leaſt, morning and euening: and moreouer, at leaſt once a yeare, be taken all in peeces, to ſcoure awaie the ruſte, which it hath gathered, to mende broken peeces, and renew ſuch as be worne, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awaie that, which cannot be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo, our holy Patrone, the paterne of all perfection, hauing a zealous care of the ſoules of his louing children, vnited togeather in this holy Congregation, as the wheeles of a clocke, to healpe one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, to ſtrike the howres ſo truely, and ſpende euery moment thereof ſo piouſly, that their whole time, and actions, as far as humaine frailtie ſuffereth, may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto almightie God, ordeined that they should not onely winde vp their ſoules to God by prayer, but alſo to make them haue the more care, and be the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligenter in doing therof, appoynteth and enioyneth them penance: If in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they doe it not in the dewe hower, that is, as earely as they can conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
               <p>In the Euening alſo, he exhorteth them to doe the like, both by diligent exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their conſcience, and by making preſent ſatisfaction for any offence, that they may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to doe that day: &amp; beſides euery Moneth, hearing bow neceſſarie Pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>But foraſmuch as it is a thing naturally giuen vnto all men, to bee ſo partial in their owne affaires, that they can ſee a more in another mans eye, and not a beame in their owne: for which cauſe, fearing that for want of ſeeing their owne imperfections, the ſoule might get ſuch filth and ruſt, that hardly would it bee cleanſed and made bright in the ende: ordeineth here, that at the leaſt once in the yeare, they should take it downe, and conſider preciſely all the peeces thereof, that is, all the affections, paſſions, vnſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behauiours, ſcandalous actions, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences, whatſoeuer; that all faults and defects being found out, may be corrected and redreſſed by the Viſitor, in this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like viſitation.</p>
               <p>To viſite, ſignifieth no other thing here, then to looke into the liues, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine the conditions and maners of the brethren, and afterwardes, to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and correct their exceſſe and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, enioyning vnto them healthfull pennance, for their faultes committed, and for that end, he ordained that the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor should be a Prieſt, of ſome approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Religion.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time that this order was firſt inſtituted, our moſt louing &amp; carefull

Firſt, here he declareth (how) ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Miniſters ought to declare to the Viſitor, the manifeſt faults, of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and ſiſters, to be punished. The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor may proceede, three maner of waies in correcting the offenders: Firſt, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, whileſt hee commandeth all the brethren and ſiſters, that if any one of them doe knowe, any thing amongſt them worthie of correction, that faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he declare it. Secondly, by inquiſition and diligent inquitie, which may be made of euerie one ſecretly, ſeeing that there are manie which will be loath to accuſe
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:183844:230"/> others publikely of any crime. Thirdly, by Expoſtulation, expoſtulating diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the perſon accuſed, whether thoſe things be true which he hath heard, which if he ſeeme to deny falſely, then to bring the witneſſe face to face, and ſo procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with all charitie, to correct him in time: for that euen as a dangerous kindled fire, if it be neglected, ſoone taketh ſuch forces, that afterwardes hardly will it be quenched: ſo ſinnes not corrected in time, quickly growe ſo great, that not onely with great difficultie, will they be rooted out, but alſo ſoone infect others, or at leaſt bring with all ſpeede, infamie and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall vnto the companie where ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is tollerated. Therefore S. FRANCIS, although his deſire is, that all mutuall loue and charitie, should be maintained amongſt all the brethren and ſiſters, yet will he not in any wiſe, that an incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſon, should be ſuffered amongſt them, but doeth repeate here againe, as a matter of great weight, that after thrice warning, ſuch diſobedient perſons, as by the triple admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Miniſters, wil not be corrected, <hi>That the Ministers with the aduiſe of ſome diſcreete brethren, should denounce it vnto the Viſitor, by him to be caſt out of the companie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here now ſecondly doth S. FRANCIS declare, that the Viſitors onely haue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to inflict this ſeuere punishment of
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:183844:231"/> expulſion, and caſting quite out of the companie for euer, ſuch incorrigible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: For though the Miniſters ought to inſtruct the brethren and ſiſters, and haue a ſpecial care, to ſee that euery one, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his charge, be mindful to walke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his calling, in all vertue and pietie, and to admonish thoſe which doe otherwiſe to amende; and if their liues, being ſcandalous, and their offences hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, will not after thrice admonition, deſiſt from their wicked actions, he may debarre them from the company and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites of the Congregation, vntill the comming of the Viſitor, yet not to expel him for euer.

               </note> that Superiours, both Eccleſiaſtical and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, may binde their ſubiects, vnder the paine of a mortal ſinne; and make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and commandements, binding them thereunto.

            <p>Wherefore, ſeeing that it plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth here, by the ſentence of Pope NICOLAVS the fourth, which confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this Rule, with his Apoſtolical let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that hee would not that any should offende mortally, in tranſgreſſing any point of thoſe things which are contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein, all men are out of danger from falling into mortal ſinne, by omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any thing conteyned herein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:183844:233"/> that both S.

But ſome may peraduenture obiect, that though the Brethren and Siſters, are not bound by the Rule; yet by the vowe which they make, ſpecially aboue all other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious perſons, to obſerue the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, all their life time, doe binde themſelues, to keepe them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the paine of a double mortall ſinne; one in reſpect that the breach of them, is a mortall ſinne, to any man whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doth it. Another, in reſpect of the breach of the vowe, which they haue particularly made, or at the leaſt, one mortall ſinne, equiualent to them both. Vnto which Obiection, the vertuous and learned Father, BERNARDINVS DE BVSTIS, ſome hundred yeares paſt anſweareth directly; that though a vowe commonly of his owne nature, do binde to obſerue that promiſe, vnder the paine of a mortall ſinne, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the Vowe which is made in the profeſſion of this Rule, doeth
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:183844:233"/> not binde, but vnder the paine of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſinne: Becauſe, they which make this Vowe, doe not intende to binde themſelues, no further foorth, then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Commandement of the Rule, and the will of the Pope, which confirmeth it; which as you haue heard, hath no intention, to binde them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               </note> that concerning the Obligation of Vowes, we muſt rather regarde and looke into the intention of him that Voweth, then vnto the wordes. For that he is bounde vnto thoſe thinges whereunto his intention did intende: Wherefore (ſaith hee) that whoſoeuer maketh a vowe to faſte three daies; he is to be examined, how he did entende this faſt for that his vow is, according to his intention.</p>
            <p>From hence therefore wee do inferre that, ſeeing, as you haue heard, neither the Precepts of the Rule, or the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer thereof, nor yet the perſon which maketh the vowe, do intend to bind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, vnder mortall ſinne to keepe it, though the merit is doubled, by making this vow; yet is there no more danger, but much leſſe in them, of falling into a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſinn, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in others which make it not.</p>
